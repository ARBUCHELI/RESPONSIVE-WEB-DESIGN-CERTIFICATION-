## BASIC HTML AND HTML5

## Introduction to Basic HTML & HTML5

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language used to describe the structure of a web page. It uses a special syntax or notation to organize and give information about the page to the browser. Elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, there are different tag options to place around text to show whether it is a heading, a paragraph, or a list.

For example:
```html
<h1>Top level heading: Maybe a page title</h1>
<p>A paragraph of text. Some information we would like to communicate to the viewer. This can be as long or short as we would like.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Number one on the list</li>
  <li>Number two</li>
  <li>A third item</li>
</ol>
```

Becomes:

## Top level heading: Maybe a page title
A paragraph of text. Some information we would like to communicate to the user. This can be as long or short as we would like.
  1. Number one on the list
  2. Number two
  3. A third item

The HyperText part of HTML comes from the early days of the web and its original use case. Pages usually contained static documents that contained references to other documents. These references contained hypertext links used by the browser to navigate to the reference document so the user could read the reference document without having to manually search for it.

As web pages and web applications grow more complex, the W3 Consortium updates the HTML specification to ensure that a webpage can be shown reliably on any browser. The latest
version of HTML is HTML5.

This section introduces how to use HTML elements to give structure and meaning to your web content.

## 1. Basic HTML and HTML5: Say Hello to HTML ElementsPassed
Welcome to freeCodeCamp's HTML coding challenges. These will walk you through web development step-by-step.
First, you'll start by building a simple web page using HTML. You can edit code in your code editor, which is embedded into this web page.
Do you see the code in your code editor that says ```<h1>Hello</h1>```? That's an HTML element.

Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.

Opening tags look like this:

```<h1>```

Closing tags look like this:

```</h1>```

The only difference between opening and closing tags is the forward slash after the opening bracket of a closing tag.

Each challenge has tests you can run at any time by clicking the "Run tests" button. When you pass all tests, you'll be prompted to submit your solution and go to the next coding challenge.

To pass the test on this challenge, change your h1 element's text to say "Hello World".

```<h1>Hello World</h1>```

## 2. Basic HTML and HTML5: Headline with the h2 ElementPassed
Over the next few lessons, we'll build an HTML5 cat photo web app piece-by-piece.
The ```h2``` element you will be adding in this step will add a level two heading to the web page.

This element tells the browser about the structure of your website. ```h1``` elements are often used for main headings, while ```h2``` elements are generally used for subheadings. There are also ```h3```, ```h4```, ```h5``` and ```h6``` elements to indicate different levels of subheadings.

Add an ```h2``` tag that says "CatPhotoApp" to create a second HTML element below your "Hello World" ```h1``` element.

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>"CatPhotoApp"</h2>
```

## 3. Basic HTML and HTML5: Inform with the Paragraph Element

```p``` elements are the preferred element for paragraph text on websites. ```p``` is short for "paragraph".

You can create a paragraph element like this:

```<p>I'm a p tag!</p>```

Create a ```p``` element below your ```h2``` element, and give it the text "Hello Paragraph".

<strong>Note:</strong> As a convention, all HTML tags are written in lowercase, for example ```<p></p>``` and not ```<P></P>```.

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>"Hello Paragraph"</p>
```

## 4. Basic HTML and HTML5: Fill in the Blank with Placeholder Text

Web developers traditionally use lorem ipsum text as placeholder text. The lorem ipsum text is randomly scraped from a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome.

Lorem ipsum text has been used as placeholder text by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web.

Well, 5 centuries is long enough. Since we're building a CatPhotoApp, let's use something called "kitty ipsum text".

Replace the text inside your ```p``` element with the first few words of this kitty ipsum text: ```Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.```

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```
